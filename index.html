<div class=" text-block pa-2">
  <p class="text-body-2"> It was March 27, 2021, and an at-home day care in Grand Rapids was ready for a pool day. The day care’s owner took seven children —
     five of whom were just 2 and 3 years old — to a nearby Holiday Inn Express. She bought a room to use the hotel’s splash pad and two indoor pools, and charged parents $25 per child.</p>
</div>

<div class=" text-block pa-2">
  <p class="text-body-2"> None of the children had life jackets or arm floaties. The caregiver, Melanie Williams, was the only adult overseeing the seven children. At the time, Michigan law required one adult for, at most, four children at licensed at-home day cares. That rule has since been relaxed by state lawmakers to allow one caregiver for up to seven children.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="step text-block pa-2">
  <p class="text-body-2"> At 6:38 p.m., one of the smaller children — identified only as “Child P” in state investigators’ reports — ran away from the kiddie pools and climbed into the larger adult pool.

<div class=" text-block pa-2">

    Luckily, an off-duty paramedic and an off-duty nurse on vacation with their own children were nearby, and pulled the child out of the water, surveillance footage shows.

<p class="text-h2 scrolly-subhed">Nearly double the child care deserts</p>
<p class="text-body-2">At the beginning of the pandemic, the Michigan League for Public Policy, a Lansing-based nonprofit, created a list of 11 so-called <span class="orange-span">"child care deserts.”</span> These are regions where three children compete for every available slot at an in-home or group center.

<p class="text-body-2">But those deserts were calculated using the capacity of licensed child care facilities located in a particular county. The practice overstates the number of spots available and thus hides the true picture of child care availability in Michigan. Many of these licensed child care slots remain empty for a variety of reasons.
</p>
</div>            
</div>
<div class="step" data-step="3">
<div class="text-block pa-2">

<div class="text-block pa-2">
  <p class="text-body-2">
    After seeing the new data, <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.ecic4kids.org/&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1661460719864915&usg=AOvVaw1H2FcJ5j7Y55nVHgAEaHGk">Michigan’s Early Childhood Investment Corp.</a> a public organization that contracts with the state to help run the child care system, said that it didn’t know the original child care desert figure was flawed, and that the original numbers were calculated using the best available data at that time.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="text-block pa-2">
  <p class="text-body-2">
    Based on the new, larger numbers, “it’s clear that families do not have access to child care to meet their needs,” the ECIC said in a statement. 
  </p>
</div>

<!--Findings Section-->
<article class="findings text-block text-body-2 pa-2">
  <p id="findings-title">Key Findings:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Statewide capacity estimates of 373,000 day care “slots” for Michigan’s children are an illusion. Actual enrollments are closer to 336,000. The gap of about 37,000 slots reflects key industry pain points such as staffing, high costs and the disruption caused by COVID-19.  
    </li>

    <li>
      About 23% of centers that received state grants don’t serve newborns up to 3-year-olds, a critical age range for care. Out of a total of 140,000 slots at grant recipient facilities, roughly 11,500just 12,000 served infants and another 3029,000 served toddlers. 
    </li>

    <li>
      During the pandemic, closures heavily outpaced openings. Since February 2020, Michigan has 637 fewer child care providers, a 7% drop, according to state data. Family providers closed at several times the rate of high capacity centers in urban areas, a shift that exacerbates the daycare drought for rural parents. In 2018, a pre-covid year, 1,000 group and family homes closed, while just 486 centers opened to replace them.
    </li>

    <li>
      A cumulative statewide waiting list includes at least 54,057 children. On a population-adjusted basis, a waiting list of more than 3,200 was the longest, by far, in Grand Traverse County, a rural, northwest Michigan county which saw more than a third of its childcare facilities close over the past three years. As of June, Oakland, Kent and Washtenaw counties all had waitlists longer than 5,000.    </li>

    <li>
      State aid missed 2,364 providers, a reflection of disinterest in government help, even as the child care business model becomes increasingly untenable. Providers cited concerns around government intrusion into their curriculum and mistrust that the grants would really be tax-free.
    </li>

  </ul>
</article>

<div class="text-block pa-2">
  <p class="text-body-2">
    Advocates, policymakers and experts said that bad data has long dogged efforts to improve the state’s child care industry and that the findings from “Disappearing Day Care” only underscores the lingering problems.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="text-block pa-2">
  <p class="text-body-2">
    State Rep. Brenda Carter (D-Oakland County), who sits on the Michigan House Families, Children and Seniors Committee, said our findings show “just how urgent” the need for child care reforms have become.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="text-block pa-2">
  <p class="text-body-2">
    Lisa Brewer-Walraven, director of the Michigan Department of Education’s Childcare Division, said she didn’t dispute that more counties than previously known qualify as deserts. “What we’re focused on is the solutions,” Brewer-Walraven said. 
  </p>
</div>

<div class="text-block pa-2">
  <p class="text-body-2">
    Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a first-term Democrat running for re-election this year, has made expanding child care one of her administration’s key initiatives, noting her “first-hand experience” in trying to find affordable child care and pledging $100 million in state money to open 1,000 more child care facilities by 2024. In a point-by-point response to our findings, her office asserted that “under Gov. Whitmer’s leadership, the state has worked with providers to keep them open and serving kids” and provided testimonials from nearly 900 providers who received grant funding.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="text-block pa-2">
  <p class="text-body-2">
    But her office also noted the daunting issues facing Michigan’s child care industry — and the net loss of more than 600 providers during the pandemic.
  </p>
</div>


<div class="text-block pa-2">
  <p class="text-body-2">
    “All families deserve to have child care that meets their needs — regardless of where they live, how much money they make, their race, ethnicity or immigration status,” the governor’s office said in a statement. “In too many Michigan communities, families cannot find the child care they need.”
  </p>

<div class="text-block pa-2 text-body-2">

    The real number
  </p>
</div>

<div class="text-block pa-2">
  <p class="text-body-2">
    Less than half of Michigan’s 8,000 active child care facilities give real-time numbers to the state. For these providers, who work with Michigan’s Great Start to Quality program, officials can see each facilities’ enrollment numbers.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="text-block pa-2">
  <p class="text-body-2">
    For more than 4,000 other facilities, however, the Michigan Department of Education knows only their licensed maximum. That number, known as “license capacity,” can be significantly different from the actual number of children enrolled at a given time. 
  </p>
</div>

<div class="text-block pa-2">
  <p class="text-body-2">
    Child care finance expert Louise Stoney described license capacity as a useless number for planning purposes. Stoney’s group, Opportunities Exchange, consults with a number of state education departments on the economics of early education reform.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="text-block pa-2">
  <p class="text-body-2">
    “The real issue is staffed capacity,” Stoney said. “How many classrooms are you staffed to run? That’s the real number.”
  </p>
</div>

<div class="text-block pa-2">
  <p class="text-body-2">
    But many Michigan providers said they haven’t been able to fully staff in months. Some run as many as 80 children under capacity, even as parents line up at the door for coveted spots.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="text-block pa-2">
  <p class="text-body-2">
    The most in-demand openings are those for the youngest children, ranging from newborns to 3 years old.
     They also require the most attention, which means more staff.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="text-block pa-2">
  <p class="text-body-2">
    At River’s Edge Learning Center in Bay City, the shortage of employees has meant that owner Danaea Trombley has limited how many children she can enroll. “If we don’t get three or four more staff, we can’t open up that toddler room,” Trombley said.
     In December 2021, Trombley was running under capacity by 30 children.

<div class="text-block pa-2">
  <p class="text-body-2">
    From an economic perspective, providers say they are crushed between the effort to keep staff and run a profitable business. Emily Myers, owner of Ferndale Montessori in Oakland County, said that after paying utilities, wages and benefits, she puts aside only 2  to 3 percent of the school’s profits. That sum often gets reinvested, however. 
  </p>
</div>

<div class="text-block pa-2">
  <p class="text-body-2">
    “This is for when the furnace goes out, repairs, incidentals,” Myers said. “At this point, I have not added to a nest egg or rainy day fund for this business, until the grant money.”

    But offering health insurance allows her to keep employees, who are often tempted away from private child care into the relative comfort of Michigan’s public school system or other higher-paying industries.

    “Our people can go literally anywhere and make more than they can in child care,” said Linda Smith, executive director of the Bipartisan Policy Center’s Early Childcare Initiative, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank. “When it costs more than the consumer can afford to pay, then the business model is failing — hence the issues with staffing. It’s the same problem that we’ve had for decades, only magnified.”

    To pay more, providers have to charge more. But parents already pay as much as 35% of their household income for child care, according to the Economic Policy Institute. In response to a public callout from MuckRock, one parent in Mount Pleasant, Monica Rosen, said that paying for her daughter’s preschool pushed her family to the brink of poverty.

    The pandemic pulled thousands of Michigan mothers out of the workforce entirely. Data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics analyzed by RegionTrack — an Oklahoma-based consulting group — found that 6% of working women with childcare-aged children in Michigan dropped out of the workforce in 2020. The drop, from 71 to 65 percent, had recovered somewhat to 68 percent in 2021. For single mothers the drop was worse: 13 percent left the workforce, with just 4 percent returning in 2021.

  <p class="text-body-2">
    The Grand Rapids day care owner who took seven children to the Holiday Inn told investigators that Child P had run away to follow some friends into the bigger swirl pool unnoticed. She stood just 3 ⅓ feet tall and wore a polka dot Minnie Mouse bathing suit.
    </a>
  </p>
</div>

<div class=" text-block pa-2">
  <p class="text-body-2">
    Surveillance footage from the pool showed the entire incident lasted 7 minutes and there were at least 21 children in the pool area.
  </p>
</div>

<div class=" text-block pa-2">
  <p class="text-body-2">
    It all happened, Williams told deputies, “in a blink of an eye.”
  </p>
</div>

<div class=" text-block pa-2">
  <p class="text-body-2">
    An off-duty nurse gave the child mouth-to-mouth resuscitation for more than a minute and the off-duty paramedic then performed chest compressions for an additional 80 seconds, the footage shows. After three rounds of chest compressions, the little girl “came to,” they said, and vomited water before being taken to a nearby hospital.

    A month later, Williams’s day care license was revoked by the state and, in settlement documents, she did not deny the allegations.
     In hours of bodycam footage obtained for this project, Williams was clearly shaken and crying shortly after the incident,
      and told deputies that she is normally “so good with my kids.” 
  </p>
</div>

<div class=" text-block pa-2">
  <p class="text-body-2">
    A charge of third-degree child abuse was forwarded from the Kent County Sheriff’s Department to the county prosecutor’s office, records show, but the office declined to charge Williams, concluding that it appeared to be an accident, Kent County Prosecutor Chris Becker said. After the little girl was taken to the hospital, bodycam footage shows one deputy privately confiding to another:

  </p>
</div>

<div class=" text-block pa-2">

    Child P’s guardian also didn’t want to press charges against Williams and, in fact,
     returned the girl to the same day care before it ultimately closed. Williams hung up the phone when reached for comment for this story.
  </p>
</div>

<div class=" text-block pa-2">
  <p class="text-body-2">
    Meanwhile, investigative reports by state regulators raise concerning flags about children’s safety as workers leave the industry. 
  </p>
</div>

<div class=" text-block pa-2">
  <p class="text-body-2">
    In March 2021, a Novi child care worker accidentally let a child fall off a changing table, and didn't alert others until later in the day because she was "too busy" watching other infants and "did not have time" to report it, at a facility that repeatedly has staffing turnover. The caregiver was ultimately fired.
  </p>
</div>

<div class=" text-block pa-2">
  <p class="text-body-2">
    And in September 2021, a facility in Canton was found to have just two staff members looking after 28 toddlers. 
    Two days later, inspectors found that, at one point, the facility had allowed just one staff member to care for 35 toddlers.
     The facility still maintains an active license.
  </p>
</div>

<div class=" text-block pa-2">
  <p class="text-body-2">
    The Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs (LARA), which regulates and investigates complaints about child care facilities, said it prioritizes the safety of children. But the agency has found more than 9,000 child care staff vacancies across the state and is now letting some facilities apply for rule exemptions to hire younger staff who are finishing required coursework and are awaiting final certifications. 
  </p>
</div>

<div class=" text-block pa-2">
  <p class="text-body-2">
    A survey the agency sent out this spring found that staffing turnover affected a majority of facilities and ranked as the No. 1 factor affecting the number of available child care openings.
  </p>
</div>

<div class=" text-block pa-2">
  <p class="text-body-2">
    Complaint data shared by LARA shows that annual complaints dipped in 2020 and 2021, with numbers from this year on track to return to pre-pandemic levels. In that same period, the agency has seen a more than 200% spike in investigations of “Professional Development Requirements,” a category that includes health and safety training for new staff members. LARA spokesperson Suzanne Thelen suggested the spike could be linked to new professional requirements added by the agency in December 2019.
  </p>
</div>

<div class=" text-block pa-2">
  <p class="text-body-2">
    “There is a balancing act between the need for care and child care being a silent driver of the economy, but our role is to protect the health, safety and welfare of those kids in care,” said Emily Laidlaw, the director of Michigan’s Childcare Licensing Bureau. 
  </p>
</div>

<div class=" text-block pa-2">
  <p class="text-body-2">
    Asked about staffing and safety violations, both MDE and LARA said their focus was on creating a “one-stop-shop” for providers to resolve questions and come back into compliance with regulators. With a hotline to providers, the agencies hope they can pre-empt more violations.
  </p>
</div>

<div class=" text-block pa-2">
  <p class="text-body-2">
    Legislators know that parents and providers are pleading for help, but have reached little consensus about a solution.

</div>

<div class=" text-block pa-2">
  <p class="text-body-2">
    In past legislative sessions, Republican lawmakers advanced and passed bills intended to clear a cobweb of licensing rules that they say are suffocating small providers. Some bills were contentious, like one that expands the number of children in-home providers can look after. The bill was proposed and passed by state Rep. Jack O’Malley, a Republican who represents rural Grand Traverse County, which has the longest waiting list for child care of any county in the state.
  </p>
</div>

<div class=" text-block pa-2">
  <p class="text-body-2">
    “I talked to providers. They told me, ‘If I could have just one more kid I could probably make enough money to stay in business,” O’Malley said.
  </p>
</div>


<div class=" text-block pa-2">
  <p class="text-body-2">
    Some Democratic legislators are hesitant to relax rules, and instead have pushed for solutions that funnel more state funding — potentially from a $7 billion budget surplus — toward buttressing or reforming the child care business model. 
  </p>
</div>

<div class=" text-block pa-2">
  <p class="text-body-2">
    Whitmer has also championed the issue, directing a $1.4 billion pot of federal money toward one-time grants for providers. Some providers received as much as $630,000. The Whitmer administration also expanded eligibility for state-subsidized child care by 100,000 families.
  </p>
</div>

<div class=" text-block pa-2">
  <p class="text-body-2">
    The grants helped providers clear debts, give bonuses to workers and offer scholarships to lower-income parents, according to state data and hundreds of provider testimonials. But experts say the one-time money failed to substantively fix child care. 
  </p>
</div>

<div class=" text-block pa-2">
  <p class="text-body-2">
    “It wasn’t long-term money. So programs really didn’t spend it to raise wages permanently, because they were facing this cliff,” said Smith, with the Bipartisan Policy Center’s Early Childcare Initiative. “What they have done is given some type of one-time bonuses. But very few really raised the wages of the workforce, which now is complicating everything because wages have gone up so much elsewhere.”
  </p>

<div class=" text-block pa-2">
  <p class="text-body-2">
    Brewer-Walraven said she backed the new bills, specifically citing the ratio change “as good for providers.”
  </p>

<div class=" text-block pa-2">
  <p class="text-body-2">
    In a statement, Whitmer’s spokesman, Bobby Leddy, said that the governor “is using every tool in her toolbox” to address “decades of disinvestment in child care.” 
  </p>
</div>

<div class=" text-block pa-2">
  <p class="text-body-2">
    The Whitmer administration has also introduced a program called TriShare, which splits child care tuition among the employer, the state and parents. Whitmer has also set a goal to open 1,000 new child care facilities, backed with a $100 million commitment. Of that total, $11.4 million is being directed toward recruiting staff.
  </p>
</div>

<div class=" text-block pa-2">
  <p class="text-body-2">
    However, with the exception of a $2.5 million investment in TriShare, all of the child care relief money has come from federal grants. And a $77 billion state budget passed in June allots just $34 million new dollars towards early childhood education. The money is destined for Michigan’s Great Start to Readiness Program, a state-funded preschool program for at-risk kids.
  </p>
</div>

<div class=" text-block pa-2">

    Otherwise, the budget identifies leftover dollars from the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) for use in further child care relief.

    The Children’s Funding Project, a policy group that researches revenue options for child care systems, has tracked how different states used the one-time funds, as well as if they backed the one-time relief with legislation. 
  </p>
</div>

<div class=" text-block pa-2">
  <p class="text-body-2">
    Gaines, CEO of the Children’s Funding Project, said she was surprised that the Whitmer administration – which in 2019 pitched universal pre-K – wasn’t investing state funds in child care reform. “There’s not a lot in there outside the initial [ARPA] investment,” Gaines said.

    How we analyzed Michigan child care data
  </p>
  <p class="text-body-2">
    Since 2021, Michigan legislators have publicly quoted a number estimating that 44% of Michiganders live in a child care “desert.” In reality, that number, calculated by the Michigan League for Public Policy, misinterprets the Center for American Progress’ (CAP) definition of what is a child care desert. 
  </p>

  <p class="text-body-2">
    The MLPP’s desert calculation includes 5-year-olds while the CAP’s analysis includes only children under 5. Our analysis relies on CAP’s narrower age range, as well as more precise enrollment data, to find at least nine more deserts in Michigan than the MLPP originally calculated. 
  </p>

  <p class="text-body-2">
    In response to questions, CAP said the narrower age range is preferable because many 5-year-olds are enrolled in kindergarten or public school programs. But the MLPP; Michigan’s Early Childhood Investment Corp. a public organization that contracts with the state to help run the child care system; and the governor’s office defended their methodology. “Trusted child care advocates use the 0-5 age range to analyze various issues affecting child care in our state and the subsequent data leads to identical calls for expanded resources and support to address this critical shortage,” said Bobby Leddy, a spokesperson for the governor.
  </p>

  <p class="text-body-2">
    Our reporting on Michigan’s child care industry relies on data released by Michigan in response to state Freedom of Information Act requests. In March, we requested data that had been self-reported by providers who applied for two rounds of Child Care Stabilization Grants, as part of a $1.4 billion pot of federal relief funds. The data gave us two glimpses into roughly 5,900 child care providers out of a total pool of roughly 7,900 across the state.
  </p>

  <p class="text-body-2">
    Those providers told the state about their current enrollments, as well as about their waiting lists, staffing needs and expenses. We calculated wait lists by county and the number of providers that didn’t apply for grant monies using these figures. We also used enrollment figures to help calculate day care deserts, which previously had been calculated only using licensed capacity — or the maximum number of children that facilities can legally enroll. 
  </p>

  <p class="text-body-2">
    Interviews with providers indicated that enrollment numbers offered a more accurate picture of a particular county’s child care needs. This is often because facilities are short-staffed but also because many parents simply can’t afford child care. In some cases, parents said they were too anxious about COVID-19 to return their children to day care facilities, however it’s not clear if those fears are still a main driver given the availability of a vaccine for children as young as 6 months old.
  </p>

  <p class="text-body-2">
    To calculate deserts, we cross-referenced enrollments from the 5,900 grant recipients with the licensed capacity of the 2,000 non-applicants. In this way, we assumed an enrolled-to-capacity scenario for centers for which we had no information. 
  </p>

  <p class="text-body-2">
    As a result, the 20 county “deserts” we identify are a minimum estimate. If we had actual enrollment numbers for every facility in the state, it’s likely that several additional Michigan counties would qualify as deserts; Twenty-three counties are mere rounding errors away from the 3-to-1 threshold.
